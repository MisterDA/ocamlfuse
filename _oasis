Synopsis: OCaml bindings for FUSE (Filesystem in UserSpacE)
Description: This is a binding to FUSE for the OCaml programming language,
  enabling you to write multithreaded filesystems in the OCaml language. It
  has been designed with simplicity as a goal, as you can see by looking at
  example/fusexmp.ml. Efficiency has also been a separate goal. The Bigarray
  library is used for read and writes, allowing the library to do zero-copy in
  OCaml land.
